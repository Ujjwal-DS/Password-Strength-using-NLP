# Password-Strength-using-NLP
* The task is to check Password strength using Logistic Regression model. For Processing the text data I've used TF-IDF which is a NLP technique to Preprocess the text data into vectors for ML models. It shows three values(0 , 1 , 2) i.e. 0 for weak, 1 for medium, 2 for strong. Strength of the password based on rules(such as containing digits, special symbols , etc.).
* Here classification is done using NLP and Logistic Regression.
* The dataset is taken from Kaggle
